# Academic Project: Bird Frenzy

You are a cute little bird who has severely made all the other birds angry by stealing their food. Defend yourself from the wave of bird attacks!

## Game Design

- This is a 2D shoot ‘em-up game made in Unity in which players must defend themselves from waves of enemy birds by shooting seeds.
- The purpose of this project was to demonstrate an understanding of time, vectors, vector-based movement, and develop a custom collision detection method.
- This was coded without the use of Unity’s built in collision methods.
- All art was created by me. 

## Controls

- Movement: WASD
- Fire: J
